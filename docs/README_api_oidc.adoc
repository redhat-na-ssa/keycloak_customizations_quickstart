= API Gateway security using LDAP backed OIDC

The quickstart in your OpenShift environment can further be used to investigate details of the JSON Web Token (JWT) based _access token_ required by the API Gateway of 3scale.

:numbered:

=== Pre-reqs:

. _3scale API Manager and Tenant_ (version 2.11)
+
Your OpenShift cluster should have the 3scale API _Manager_ and _Tenant_ installed (preferrably via the 3scale Operator).

. _3scale APIcast Gateway_ (version 2.11)

.. An apicast gateway should be provioned via the OpenShift operator in the _user1-services_ namespace

=== Additional Environment Variables

-----
API_SSO_CLIENT_ID=0171daa2                                              # auto-generated in RH-SSO by zync
API_SSO_CLIENT_CRED=ec37f4b50fc6d78fa43b61111029b99d                    # auto-generated in RH-SSO by zync
API_GW_URL=https://apicast-gw-user1-services.$OCP_DOMAIN
-----

=== Smoke Test API Gateway
. Retrieve an OAuth2 token using the Zync-queue created SSO client (in the API GW related SSO Realm) corresponding to the API application Id :
+
-----
TKN=$(curl -X POST "$ACCESS_TOKEN_URL" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
            -d "username=jbrown" \
            -d "password=password" \
            -d "grant_type=password" \
            -d "client_id=$API_SSO_CLIENT_ID" \
            -d "client_secret=$API_SSO_CLIENT_CRED" \
            -d "scope=openid" \
            | sed 's/.*access_token":"//g' | sed 's/".*//g')

$ echo $TKN
-----

. Invoke frontend service: 
+
-----
$ curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $TKN" \
       -X GET $API_GW_URL/frontend



< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Hello jbrown with roles: ldap-user ldap-admin

=== JWT claims used by 3scale API GW

API GW extracts the value of the _azp_ or _aud_ claim of the access token and uses it as the Client ID that identifies the application in 3scale to authorize the call through the 3scale _Service Management API_. 

In practice, the _azp_ claim contains the SSO clientId that issued the access token.
That should be sufficient.
Unfortunately, as per link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/THREESCALE-7006[THREESCALE-7006], the gateway also requires the _aud_ claim to be populated (the contents of which do not need to be accurate).

Otherwise, the following is an example failure in _apicast_ (when apicast logLevel: debug): 

-----
2021/12/27 23:42:23 [debug] 28#28: *13 oidc.lua:191: verify(): [jwt] failed verification for token, reason: 'aud' claim is required., requestID=f9e14f4fb6019ad77b5b162fe6def0f3
2021/12/27 23:42:23 [debug] 28#28: *13 proxy.lua:287: rewrite(): oauth failed with 'aud' claim is required., requestID=f9e14f4fb6019ad77b5b162fe6def0f3
-----

==== Determine value of _aud_ field in access token:

. Execute:
+
-----
$ jq -R 'split(".") | .[1] | @base64d | fromjson' <<< $TKN | jq .aud

[
  "realm-management",
  "broker",
  "account"
]
-----

. If the above returns _null_ then proceed to the next section to manually populate the _aud_ field of the access token:


==== Manual Fix

The sso realm configuration of this quickstart should by default generate access tokens whose _aud_ claim is populated.  So all is good.  
If not, then execute the following:

. Navigate to: `Users -> View all users -> <link to user> -> Role Mappings -> Client Roles`
. From the drop-down, select and add all _Available Roles_ from the following SSO clients:

.. _account_
.. _broker_
.. _realm-management_

Please refer to chapter 5 of link:https://smile.amazon.com/Keycloak-Management-Applications-protocols-applications/dp/1800562497[Keycloak - Identity & Access Management for Modern Apps] for more details and background regarding the _audience_ claim of a Keycloak generated _access token_.
