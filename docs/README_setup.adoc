== Components

This course includes both _docker-compose_ (for a local deployment) as well as ansible (for deployment to OpenShift).
In both cases, the following containers are deployed : 

.. *openldap*
+
System of record of user and role data.

.. *RH-SSO*
+
Provisioned with a realm enabled with _User Federation_ to openldap.
+
Keycloak 19.0.1 is used and backed by a PostgreSQL database.
Keycloak 19.0.1 is based on link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus].

.. *Frontend* service
+
Quarkus based app that exposes REST API and invokes _backend_ service (with _Authorization_ header propogated to _backend_ service).

.. *Backend-oidc* service
+
Quarkus based app that exposes REST API secured using RBAC.
The service is enabled with a _keycloak adapter_.
At start-up, this _keycloak adapter_ acquires the SSO public key.
When a request is sent to this service, the _access token_ in the request is validated using this SSO public key. 

.. *Token Inspector*
+
Bare minimum JavaScript based Single Page Application (SPA).

.. *MailHog*
+
SMTP & web mail simulator for local development and testing. 

== Deployment Environments
The exercises in this quickstart can be run locally (via `docker-compose`) or in OpenShift.

  "access" : {
    "manageGroupMembership" : true,
    "view" : true,
    "mapRoles" : true,
    "impersonate" : true,
    "manage" : true
  }
} ]
-----

=== OpenShift
This quickstart includes _ansible_ to deploy to an OpenShift environment.  All of the same tests conducted in your local environment can be executed in your OpenShift environment.


==== Pre-reqs:
. _OpenShift_ cluster ( >= v 4.10 )
+
The cluster should have about 6 GBs and 6 CPUs to allocate to the resources of this quickstart.

. link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/?C=M;O=D[oc utility]
+
Needs to correspond to the version of your OpenShift cluster.
+
You should be authenticated into your OpenShift cluster at the command line as a `cluster-admin` user.


. *ansible*
+
Installed locally with the following collections:

.. link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/index.html[kubernetes]

... Install: 
+
-----
$ ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core
-----

... Test:
+
-----
$ ansible-doc -t module kubernetes.core.helm
-----
+
You should see output similar to the following: 
+
-----
> KUBERNETES.CORE.HELM    (/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible_collections/kubernetes/core/plugins/modules/helm.py)

        Install, upgrade, delete packages with the Helm package
        manager.

ADDED IN: version 0.11.0 of kubernetes.core
...
-----

.. link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/5/collections/community/general/docsite/filter_guide_selecting_json_data.html[jmespath]
+
ie: On Linux systems, the following steps tend to work: 

... Check version of python used by ansible:
+
-----
$ ansible --version


ansible [core 2.12.2]
  ...

  python version = 3.8.12 (default, Sep 16 2021, 10:46:05) [GCC 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-3)]

  ...

-----
... Using the version of python leveraged by ansible, install dependency as root user:
+
-----
# python3.8 -m pip install jmespath
-----





==== Ansible based provisioning


. Change directory into the _ansible_ directory of this project: 
+
-----
$ cd ansible
-----

. Create a secret with certs for your RH-SSO endpoint:
+
-----
$ oc new-project rhi-idm
$ oc create secret tls keycloak-tls \
        --cert /path/to/fullchain.cert \
        --key /path/to/cert.key \
        -n rhi-idm
-----

. Execute _ansible_playbook_
+
-----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/install.yml
-----

. The playbook provisions the following in OpenShift:

.. *rhi_idm* namespace:
... *openldap*
... *RH-SSO*

.. *user1-services* namespace: 
... *frontend* service
... *backend* service
... *token-inspector* web app


==== Environment Variables

. Set the following environment variables with values similar to the following:
+
-----
export RHSSO_NS=rhi-idm
export OCP_DOMAIN=apps$(oc whoami --show-console | awk 'BEGIN{FS="apps"}{print $2}')
export RHSSO_HOST=rhsso-$RHSSO_NS.$OCP_DOMAIN
export RHSSO_URL=https://$RHSSO_HOST
export RHSSO_MASTER_PASSWD=$(oc get secret rhsso-initial-admin -o json -n $RHSSO_NS | jq -r .data.password | base64 -d)

export USER_ID=user1
export REALM_ID=$USER_ID-kc-demo
export REALM_ADMIN=ssoRealmAdmin
export REALM_ADMIN_PASSWD=admin
export OIDC_TOKEN_URL="$RHSSO_URL/realms/$REALM_ID/protocol/openid-connect/token"

export BACKEND_ROUTE=http://backend-oidc-$USER_ID-services.$OCP_DOMAIN
export FRONTEND_ROUTE=http://frontend-oidc-$USER_ID-services.$OCP_DOMAIN
-----

=== Sanity Check

-----
$ curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" \
       -X GET $FRONTEND_ROUTE/sanityCheck
-----


== RH-SSO Consoles and Endpoints

=== RH-SSO Site Admin
. Open a web browser and navigate to the RH-SSO console of the `master` realm :
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n$RHSSO_URL/admin/master/console\n\n"
-----

. Authenticate using `admin` as the userId and the value of the `$RHSSO_MASTER_PASSWD` environment variable as the password.
. As the RH-SSO site admin, you have full access to all of its resources.
+

=== RH-SSO Realm Admin

. Open a web browser and navigate to the console of your realm :
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n$RHSSO_URL/admin/$REALM_ID/console\n\n"
-----

. Authenticate using `ssoRealmAdmin` as the userId and `admin` as the password.
. As the RH-SSO realm admin, you have full access to all resources pertaining to your realm.
+
image::images/realm_homepage.png[]

. Invoke _Discovery Endpoint_ of RH-SSO to view details of OIDC related REST APIs specific to your realm:
+
-----
$ curl -v -X GET "$RHSSO_URL/realms/$REALM_ID/.well-known/openid-configuration" | jq .
-----


=== RH-SSO Account Console
Throughout this course, you'll need to access the Red Hat SSO `account console` as an authenticated user.

. Open a new private window in your browser.
+
Doing so will ensure that there are not browser cookie related conflicts between users logged into the RH-SSO `admin console` and this user logged into the SSO `account console`.

. Navigate to the RH-SSO `Account Console` of your realm :
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n$RHSSO_URL/realms/$REALM_ID/account\n\n"
-----

. Authenticate using the following credentials: 

.. UserId:  `jbrown`
.. Password: `password`
+
image::images/account_console.png[]

NOTE:  This user does not yet have the ability to do anything in the SSO account console.  We'll fix this in a later lab.


== Token Inspector webapp
This lab includes a simple javascript based web app to display the OAuth2 _access_ and _refresh_ tokens.
It also allows for display of the OIDC _Id_ token.

The reason the _Token Inspector Webapp_ can display the _access_ and _refresh_ tokens is becauase it is a Javascript based _Single-Page App_ (SPA) with no intermediary REST API that supports it.  That means that this app is a _public_ SSO client that interacts directly with the SSO _authorization server_ and as such retrieves the _access_ and _refresh_ tokens as per the _Authorization Code_ flow.

This architecture, although easy to implement, is not particularly secure.
For more secure architectures involving an SPA, please read the section entitled _Securing a SPA with an intermediary REST API_ in Chapter 6 of the link:https://smile.amazon.com/Keycloak-Management-Applications-protocols-applications/dp/1800562497[Keycloak - Identity & Access Management for Modern Apps] book.

This web app was plagarized from the lab assets provided by the link:https://smile.amazon.com/Keycloak-Management-Applications-protocols-applications/dp/1800562497[Keycloak - Identity & Access Management for Modern Apps] book.
Subsequently, all credit for the _token inspector_ web app goes to the author of that book.  Thank you!

. Open a private web browser and navigate to:  http://localhost:8000
. Switch to the _Network_ tab of your _Web Developer Tools_ on that page.
+
image::images/browser_network_tools.png[]

. Click the `Login` button at the top-left corner of the page
. Notice the re-direction to the URL of the app's _SSO Realm_.  What are the request parameters?
. in the RH-SSO login form, authenticate using the following credentials:
.. *UserId* :  jbrown
.. *Password* :  password
. Notice the re-direction back to the _Token Inspector_ web app.
+
In the request to the _/token_ endpoint, what are the request parameters and what is included in the response ?
